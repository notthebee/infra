This repo is a living document of me trying to configure my home server/NAS using the principles of _Infrastracture as Code_.

You can read more about IaS here: [https://perfectmediaserver.com/concepts/infraascode.html](https://perfectmediaserver.com/concepts/infraascode.html)

### Special thanks
* David Stephens for his [Ansible NAS](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) project. This is where I got the idea and "borrowed" a lot of concepts and implementations from.
* Jeff Geerling for his book, [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) and his [Ansible 101 series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN) on YouTube.
* Jonathan Hanson for his [SSH port juggling](https://gist.github.com/triplepoint/1ad6c6060c0f12112403d98180bcf0b4) implementation.
